<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The core package represents the key data structures of the user-defined property.
Other packages build on this class to add, remove, replace a user-defined property.
UI can add listener to the design element to accept the notification event sent 
each time the operation is done, undone or redone.
<p>
The key classes in this package include:
<p><ul>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.api.core.Listener} is the interface class
to accept the notification event sent by all report elements. See the extensive
documentation in this class for information about the services common to all report
elements.</li>

<li>{@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.api.core.UserPropertyDefn} provides generic
access to a user-defined property. The class provides some getter/setters to the name,
type, choices, and so on.</li>
</ul>
