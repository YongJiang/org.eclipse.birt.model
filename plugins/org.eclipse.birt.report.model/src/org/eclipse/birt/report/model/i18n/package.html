Provides the necessary translation classes for report internationalization.<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The i18n package defines the message files and&nbsp; which are used to do the 
localized translation.
<p>
The key classes in this package include:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.i18n.ThreadResources} Provides access 
to a resource bundle associated with this thread. The&nbsp;&nbsp; application 
calls setThreadLocale to set the locale for the<br>
&nbsp;thread, then calls the getMessage methods.<br>
¡¡</li>

<li>{@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.i18n.ResourceHandle} Represents a set 
of resources for a given package and locale. This class will<br>
&nbsp;associate with a user session. Each user session has a single locale. This 
class assumes that the resources are in the same location as the class itself, 
and are named &quot;Messages.properties&quot;, &quot;Messages_xx.properties&quot;, etc. Once stable, 
the application will not access a message that does not exist.To help get the 
system stable, this class raises an assertion if the message key refers to a 
missing exception. The class then returns the message key itself as the message.<br>
¡¡</li>
</ul>
