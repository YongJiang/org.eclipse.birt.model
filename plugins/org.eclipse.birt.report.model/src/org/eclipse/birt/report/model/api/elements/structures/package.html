Defines the structure types in Model system.<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p class="MsoBodyText">In ROM, some properties are composed of multiple values. For 
example, an Action (hyperlink) property has a URL, a target window name, and 
more. A property structure allows a single property to provide a set of related 
values. A property structure is just like a structure in C or C++, and is 
similar to an object in Java or JavaScript. Structures have no members, they 
just have a set of properties.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Structures also have a name. ROM uses the structure name 
be 
to determine the properties that make up the structure. Some structure names are&nbsp; ¡°Action¡±,¡°CustomColor¡±, 
etc.</p>
