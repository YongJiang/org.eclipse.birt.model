Provides commands that modify the state of the Design Engine.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The application modifies a report design using a set of <em>commands</em>.
Each command does the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Checks the arguments of the call.</li>
<li>Validates that the requested change is valid.</li>
<li>Creates an <em>activity record</em> to perform the change in a way
that can be undone.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Most commands have four parts:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The command class itself.</li>
<li>An exception thrown if an error occurs. Many exceptions provide
detailed error codes to clearly identify what went wrong.</li>
<li>The activity record class that records the change in a way that
can be undone and redone.</li>
<li>A notification event sent to the UI each time the operation is
done, undone or redone.</li>
</ul>

The application generally uses the API handle classes to work with a
design. These handle classes use the commands defined here to modify
the design.
