<h1>FreeForm</h1>

<p>Container that use free-form layout which position an element at (x,y) location.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The simplest form of report layout is free-form. Free-form layout is best for layouts 
that do not have a regular structure, such as a header for a tabular report. This layout 
option needs little explanation.</p>

<p>A container item holds a collection of other report items. Every item in the container is
positioned at an (x, y) location relative to the top left corner of the container. Free-form
layout is very much like the layout in e.RD-Pro: elements can be positioned anywhere. A drawback
of free-form layout is that items are not automatically repositioned depending on the size of 
other elements. For example, if a large block of text is followed by another data item, the data 
item may be hidden if the block of text becomes too large.</p>
