<h1>Line</h1>

<p>Lines to add graphical interest to a report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Customers often use lines and rectangles to add graphical interest to a report. 
For example, the customer may draw a box around certain fields to group them. Or,
the customer may use alternating background colors to improve report legibility.

<p>Most reports are intended for viewing on the web. Web browsers generally support 
only horizontal and vertical, but not diagonal lines. Diagonal lines require an image 
which imposes extra cost and is difficult to correctly format. So, BRD limits support 
to horizontal and vertical lines, but not diagonal lines. 

<p>The user can set the line size, line color and line pattern using the item's style.

<p>A line item describes a line along the edge of a rectangle. If orientation is vertical, 
the line is along the left edge of the bounding box. If the line is horizontal, the line 
is along the top edge of the bounding box. That is, the X and Y properties give the line 
origin. The Width property gives the length of horizontal lines, the Height property gives 
the width of vertical lines.
