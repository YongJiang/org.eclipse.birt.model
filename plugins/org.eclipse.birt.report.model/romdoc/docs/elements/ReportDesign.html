<h1>ReportDesign</h1>

<p>The report design element represents report as a whole.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>

<p>The report design element contains the information about 
a report design. It represents the entire set of design information stored in a 
BIRT report design file.</p>

<p>The report design defines properties that describe the 
design as a whole. Report design properties do not inherit because a design 
cannot extend another design.</p>

<h4>Scripting Summary</h4>

<p>Runtime object: <code>report </code>
(global variable)</p>

<p>Design object: <code>report.design</code></p>

<p>Library element</p>

<h2 class="property">base</h2>

<p>A base directory to use when computing relative links from this report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A base directory to use when computing relative links 
from this report. Most often used for reports created externally to the server 
and submitted on the fly. Used when computing hyperlinks, library includes, 
image includes and other relative file references.  See the W3C XML Base 
standard for background:
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlbase-20010627/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlbase-20010627/</a>.

<h2 class="property">includeResource</h2>

<p>Resource file name which stores the externalized strings.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Report designs support externalized strings by storing the resource keys;
which are stored in the resource file. This property stores the resource file
name.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="property">refreshRate</h2>

<p>The refresh rate when viewing the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The refresh rate when viewing the report. The viewer will 
automatically rerun and redisplay the report. The rate is given in seconds. A 
rate of 0 means no refresh.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Default value: <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">0 (the 
report does not refresh)</span></p>

<h2 class="method">beforeFactory</h2>

<p>Perform initialization before opening the report document for writing.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Called at the start of the Factory after the initialize(&nbsp)
method and before opening the report document (if any).</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Module element <code>initialize</code> 
method</p>

<p><code>afterFactory</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">afterFactory</h2>

<p>Perform initialization before opening the report document for writing.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Called at the end of the Factory after closing the report 
document (if any). This is the last method called in the Factory.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>beforeFactory</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">beforeOpenDoc</h2>

<p>Called just before opening the report document file 
in the Factory. Allows the report to control the name and other properties of 
this file.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method just before opening the report 
document in the Factory. It allows the application to customize features of the 
report document such as its name, whether it is temporary, security, and so on. 
Code in this script will likely be specific to the deployment platform.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>afterOpenDoc</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">afterOpenDoc</h2>

<p>Called just after opening the report document file in the Factory.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Called just after opening the report document file in the 
Factory.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>beforeOpenDoc</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">beforeCloseDoc</h2>

<p>Called just before closing the report document file 
in the Factory. Allows the report to set additional properties on the file 
before closing the file.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method just after closing the report 
document in the Factory. It allows the application to customize features of the 
report document just before closing. Some deployment platforms require that 
security, document aging and similar properties be set after closing the 
document. Code in this method will likely be specific to the deployment 
platform.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>afterCloseDoc</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">afterCloseDoc</h2>

<p>Called just after closing the report document file in 
the Factory. Allows the report to perform Factory cleanup.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Called just after closing the report document file in the 
Factory. Allows the report to perform Factory cleanup.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>beforeCloseDoc</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">beforeRender</h2>

<p>Called before starting a presentation time action.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method at the start of each 
presentation-time activity such as convert a page, print a report, extract data, 
etc. Presentation activities are usually done in repose to a client request 
coming into the Presentation Engine. Code is likely to be specific to the 
deployment platform.</p>

<p>BIRT may cache the same report session across multiple 
render actions. For example, if a user wants to view pages 1 and 2, see the 
table of contents, then do a search, the Presentation Engine may elect to keep 
the report loaded and the JavaScript session in effect. This allows an 
application to perform costly presentation-time initialization once, simply keep 
a flag that indicates whether initialization has already been done by another 
render action.</p>

<p>If the report is being run and rendered in a single pass, 
then this method is called after the call to <code>
beforeFactory</code>. If the rendering operation is being done on a report 
previously created, then this method is called just after the initialize method.</p>

<p>The Presentation Engine may choose to cache a report 
design and script session across multiple render requests. In this case, each 
render operation will trigger a call to <code>beforeRender</code> 
and <code>afterRender</code>. The <code>
initialize</code> method will be called only when the report is first loaded.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>initialize</code> method</p>

<p><code>afterRender </code>method</p>

<h2 class="method">afterRender</h2>

<p>Called after completing a presentation time action.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method at the completion of each 
presentation-time activity such as convert a page, print a report, extract data, 
etc. Code is likely to be specific to the deployment platform.</p>

<p>If the report is being run and rendered in a single pass, 
then the call to <code>afterFactory</code> will precede the 
call to <code>afterRender</code>.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>beforeRender</code> method</p>

<h2 class="slot">body</h2>

<p>The visual layout sections within the report.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The body portion of a design contains a list of the 
visual report content. Content is made up of one or more sections. A section is 
a report item that fills the width of the page. Sections represent relatively 
independent divisions within the report. In CSS terminology, a section is a 
block-level element.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The simplest design 
contains a single section. However, sophisticated designs can contain any number 
of sections.</span></p>

<p>The body contains any 
number of sections, in any order.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">components</h2>

<p>Reusable report items defined in this design. Report 
items can extend these items. Defines a &quot;private library&quot; for this design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot defines reusable report items defined in this 
design. Report items can extend these items.</p>

<p>A report developer may want to use the same image, text, 
label or other item in several places within in the report. Instead of copying &amp; 
pasting, the developer can instead define the element once in the components 
slot. Then, he can use the component to create the various instances.</p>

<p>Using a reusable component helps reduce maintenance costs 
because changes are made in only one place, rather than across several copies.</p>

<p>This slot defines a &quot;private library&quot; for this design. 
Components that are used by several reports appear in a &quot;shared&quot; library file.</p>

<p>The following rules apply to the components slot:</p>

<ul>
<li>All report items in the component area must have a name. (This rule 
applies only to items directly in the component area, not to items nested inside 
of other items.)</li>

<li>All report items share a single name space, including those in the 
Components and Body.</li>

<li>Items in the Components area can extend from other items in the 
Components area of the same type. In the design file, the base components must 
physically appear before derived items.</li>

<li>Any type of report item can appear in the Components area.</li>

<li>Only report items can appear in the components area. Master pages, 
styles, data sets, data sources, parameters and other elements cannot appear.</li>

<li>Report items in the components area can contain other items if their 
definition allows. For example, a grid can contain other items.</li>
</ul>
