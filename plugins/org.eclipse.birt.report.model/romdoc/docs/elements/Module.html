<h1>Module</h1>

<p>Report design information common to report designs and 
libraries. This is most of the report except for the body.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The module element describes the common characteristics 
between libraries and designs. It provides a wide variety of properties to help 
people understand the module, and provide lists of most components: page setup, 
data sources, data sets, reusable report items, and so on. It also provides a 
list of custom color definitions.</p>

<h4>Name Spaces</h4>

<p>ROM defines a number of <i>name spaces</i> within a report 
design. A name space holds a set of named components. Each name space is 
independent of the other. ROM name spaces are:</p>

  <table class="section-table">
    <thead>
      <tr><td>Name Space</td>
        <td>Contents</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Styles</td>
      <td>Shared styles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Sources</td>
      <td>Data sources (database connections)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Sets</td>
      <td>Queries and other data sources</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Master Pages</td>
      <td>Page definitions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout Elements</td>
      <td>All visual elements such as lists, tables, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameters</td>
      <td>Report parameters</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>The name is optional for elements that can appear in the 
Layout Elements name space. The name is required for all other elements.</p>

<h2 class="property">author</h2>

<p>The person who created the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The person who created the report. The user can fill this 
in to keep track of the person who wrote the report, or is responsible for 
maintaining the report. This is purely documentation; BIRT does not use this 
property at runtime.</p>

<h2 class="property">colorPalette</h2>

<p>A set of custom color names.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The developer can define a set of custom color names as 
part of the design. The developer can then reference these names within 
properties. Defining the colors in the palette helps the developer achieve a 
consistent look throughout the report, and allows colors to be refined by 
changing just one place. </p>

<p>Every custom color has three parts: a display name, an 
internal name and an RGB value. The display name is what the developer sees. If 
the palette will be used by people in different countries, then the display name 
can be externalized and translated. The internal name identifies the color 
within the design and in the XML design file. The internal name cannot be 
localized. Finally, the RGB value gives the actual color.</p>

<h2 class="property">comments</h2>

<p>Text that describes the report design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Text that describes the report design. It can contain 
embedded HTML. The comments are notes for the people who develop and maintain 
the report. Comments cannot be externalized. BIRT does not use this information 
at runtime, it is purely documentation for the report developer.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See the <code>helpGuide</code> and the
<code>description</code> properties for a way to provide 
information for the users of the report.</p>

<h2 class="property">configVars</h2>

<p>List of configuration variables.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reports frequently have deployment-specific dependencies. For example,
developers often use a test database during development, but target a production
database once the report is deployed. Or, an OEM may use a different company
name in report titles for each of their customers. BIRT provides configuration
variables to support such cases. A configuration variable is a name/value pair.</p>

<h2 class="property">createdBy</h2>

<p>Name of the tool that created the design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Name of the tool that created the design. Designs created 
by BIRT will contain the text &quot;BIRT Version xxx&quot;. Customers or third parties who 
generate designs can insert their product name here. This is purely a 
documentation property; BIRT does not use it at runtime.</p>

<h2 class="property">includeScripts</h2>

<p>The name(s) of JavaScript files to include into this report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The name(s) of JavaScript files to include into this 
report. BIRT reads and executes these scripts before calling the
<code>initialize</code> method for the design. The scripts can 
define reusable variables, functions, objects, Java imports and so on. The 
design can contain any number of script includes.</p>

<p><code>initialize</code> method</p>

<h2 class="property">title</h2>

<p>A short description of the report presented to the user when the report is deployed.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A short description of the report presented to the user

<p><code>title</code> property</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="property">images</h2>

<p>A list of images embedded in this report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A design often uses images. Most images in a report will 
be accessed via a URL, or a file deployed externally to the report. However, 
some reports may want to embed an image directly into the report design. 
Embedded images are especially helpful if a report design is generated in a 
custom application and sent to the server for one-time execution.</p>

<p>Images have a name. The name allows an image item to 
reference the embedded image. Scripts can use the image name to retrieve the 
image from the images array:</p>

<pre class="code-block">var img = report.design.images[&quot;MyImage&quot;]</pre>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Image item</p>

<h2 class="property">units</h2>

<p>Default units to be used for the report design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="method">initialize</h2>

<p>Called when the report starts executing in either the 
Factory or Presentation engine.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method before calling any other method in 
the design. </p>

<p>BIRT calls this method at the start of the Factory and 
Presentation engines, just after loading the imports, before opening the report 
document. Implement this method to define global functions, objects, Java 
imports and other resources used throughout the report.</p>

<p>Libraries can also contain an init script and imports. 
BIRT executes these scripts in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each library, in the order that the library is included:</li>

<ul>
<li>Locate, read and execute the imported scripts in the order they appear in 
the Code Modules element.</li>
<li>Execute the <code>initialize</code> script.</li>
</ul>

<li>For the report design itself.</li>

<ul>
<li>Locate, read and execute the imported scripts in the order they appear in 
the Code Modules element.</li>
<li>Execute the init script.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>In general, the <code>initialize</code> 
method of a report design or library can reference resources defined in the
<code>initialize</code> script of any included libraries, but 
not visa-versa. This is the generally accepted meaning of an include.</p>

<h2 class="slot">parameters</h2>

<p>A list of Parameter elements that describe the data that the user can enter when running the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list of parameter elements that describe the data that 
the user can enter when running the report. BIRT supports four kinds of 
parameters identified above. The design can also include parameter groups that 
organize parameters visually.</p>

<p>The order of parameters within this slot in the design 
file determines the order that they will appear in the requester UI.</p>

<p>The parameters property provides a &quot;flattened&quot; list of 
parameters. Each parameter identifies the group (if any) to which it belongs.</p>
<p>Parameter values are also available using the
<code>params</code> global variable.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">dataSources</h2>

<p>The connections used by the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot holds the list of data sources defined within 
the report itself. Each data source must have a unique name. The order of items 
within this slot is unimportant.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">dataSets</h2>

<p>Data sets (queries) defined in the design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot holds the list of data sets defined within the 
report itself. Each data set must have a unique name. The order of items within 
this slot is unimportant.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">styles</h2>

<p>List of user-defined styles used to format elements in the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>User-defined styles used to format elements in the 
report. Each style must have a unique name within the set of styles for this 
report.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">pageSetup</h2>

<p>The layout of the master pages within the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The page setup defines the way that the report will 
appear when printed. It consists of a master page that defines the page size, 
page &quot;decoration&quot;, margins and so on. Some reports need to use different master 
pages, perhaps to have the first page of the report appear in letterhead, with 
the remaining pages on plain paper. Other reports may be printed and bound, 
requiring differing page layout for the left and right pages.</p>

<p>A report can omit the page setup information. If so, page 
setup is taken from a library, if provided. If the library is not provided, or 
does not have a page setup, or the master page does not have page dimensions, 
then the setup comes from BIRT preferences, or from locale-specific defaults.</p>

<p>If the user lists multiple master pages, but no page 
sequences, then BIRT uses the first master page by default. If the user defines 
one or more page sequences, then BIRT uses the first page sequence by default. 
Other than these two cases, the order of elements within the page setup slot is 
unimportant.</p>

<p>This slot defines a name space; the name of each master 
page and page sequence must be unique across the set of other page setup 
elements.</p>

<p>Only the simple master page is available in the first 
release, and the design can contain at most one simple master page in the first 
release.</p>

<p>The page setup can contain zero or more master pages (of 
either type) and zero or more page sequences (of either type). The simplest 
report provides no master page. It will appear with the default pages size and 
margins, and with no page header or footer.</p>
