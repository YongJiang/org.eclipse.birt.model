<h1>Module</h1>

<p>Report design information common to report designs and 
libraries. This is most of the report except for the body.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The module element describes the common characteristics 
between libraries and designs. It provides a wide variety of properties to help 
people understand the module, and provide lists of most components: page setup, 
data sources, data sets, reusable report items, and so on.</p>

<h4>Name Spaces</h4>

<p>ROM defines a number of <i>name spaces</i> within a report 
design. A name space holds a set of named components. Each name space is 
independent of the other. ROM name spaces are:</p>

  <table class="section-table">
    <thead>
      <tr><td>Name Space</td>
        <td>Contents</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Styles</td>
      <td>Shared styles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Sources</td>
      <td>Data sources (database connections)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Sets</td>
      <td>Queries and other data sources</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Master Pages</td>
      <td>Page definitions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout Elements</td>
      <td>All visual elements such as lists, tables, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameters</td>
      <td>Report parameters</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>The name is optional for elements that can appear in the 
Layout Elements name space. The name is required for all other elements.</p>
