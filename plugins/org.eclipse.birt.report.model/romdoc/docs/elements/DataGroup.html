<h1>DataGroup</h1>

<p>Represents the behavior common data properties for groups.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An element can be divided into a number of
groups.&nbsp;Groups often have subtotals. For example, a sales
report may show totals per sales rep and region.</p>

<p>A data group is defined by a <i>group key.</i>
The key is a column from the query. If the group key is a time field
then user often want to group on an <i>interval</i> such
as month or quarter.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">groupName</h2>

<p>Optional name of the group.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optional name of the group. The group name must be unique
within the list or table. The name is used to identify the group in
aggregates as explained in the scripting specification.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">keyExpr</h2>

<p>The expression for the group key.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gives the group key as an expression. The group key says when
to cause a group break listing. For example, if the group is by state,
then the group key might be "<code>row.state</code>". A
level break occurs each time the key changes. At each level break, the
current group is ended, and a new group started. The expression most
often is just a column, but can be a computed value.</p>

<h2 class="property">intervalBase</h2>

<p>In conjunction with Interval and IntervalRange, determines how
data is divided into groups.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In conjunction with Interval and IntervalRange, determines how
data is divided into groups.</p>

<h2 class="property">interval</h2>

<p>When creating intervals, this property allows grouping on a
range of contiguous values.</p>

<h3>Choices</h3>

<ul>

  <li>none: Group on individual values.</li>

  <li>prefix: Group on a string prefix</li>

  <li>year: Group on a range of years.</li>

  <li>quarter: Group on a range of quarters.</li>

  <li>month: Group on a range of months.</li>

  <li>week: Group on a range of weeks.</li>

  <li>day: Group on a range of days.</li>

  <li>hour: Group on a range of hours.</li>

  <li>minute: Group on a range of minutes.</li>

  <li>second: Group on a range of seconds.</li>

  <li>interval: Group on a numeric interval.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This property allows the group to include a range of
contiguous values. For example, a monthly sales report may want to
summarize a list of individual transactions, each of which has a
transaction date. Using the Month interval, BIRT will cause a break to
occur each time the transaction dates move into a different calendar
month.</p>

<p>Use this property with the <code>
intervalRange</code> property to select a set of contiguous
values. For example, a bi-monthly report would use the Month <code>interval</code>
with an <code>intervalRange</code> of 2.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>intervalRange</code> Property</p>

<h2 class="property">intervalRange</h2>

<p>Number of contiguous groups to merge to create a single group.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When creating intervals, this attribute allows grouping on a
range of contiguous values. For example, to show data over the span of
three hours, set the grouping interval to hours and the range to 3. The
user enters the interval range here.</p>

<p>The following shows the meaning of the range for each interval
type.</p>

<table class="section-table">

  <thead> <tr>

    <td> Interval</td>

    <td> Meaning of Range</td>

  </tr>

  </thead> <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td> None</td>

      <td> &nbsp;Ignored</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td> Prefix</td>

      <td> &nbsp;The number of characters in the prefix.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td> Date/Time</td>

      <td> &nbsp;The number of the units.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td> Interval</td>

      <td> &nbsp;The numeric interval</td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
