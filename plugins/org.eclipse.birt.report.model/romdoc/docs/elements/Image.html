<h1>Image</h1>

<p>Displays an image within the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Reports often display images in various formats: 
corporate logos, product images, icons, and so on. Popular image formats are 
JPEG for photographs, and GIF, PNG and SVG for computer-generated graphics such 
as logos.</p>
<p>The image item provides an image in one of a number of 
formats. The image can come from a number of sources. The image item can be 
sized to the image (in which case the height and width attributes are ignored), 
or the image can be sized or clipped to fit the item. Images are always scaled 
proportionately.</p>
<p>The image item is similar to the Image report element in 
RDL, the image control in AFC and the picture item in Crystal. Key features 
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Store the image as part of the report design, obtain the image at run time, or reference the image at view time.</li>

<li>Allow the image to come from a BLOB field in the query.</li>

<li>Associate a hyperlink with the image.</li>

<li>Support line images. This is an image that is repeated to form a line. For example, a slice of an image can repeat to form a custom border along the top or side of a report. Allow repetition across or down.</li>

</ul>
<p>The image element should provide a number of options for 
handling images that are larger or smaller than the size of the element itself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clip the image to fit the element. Provide options of clipping all four edges so the image remains centered in the element, or clipping the bottom and left edges.</li>

<li>Expand or shrink the element to fit the image size. This is the default, and works well for reports that use the power-assist form of layout (see below.)</li>

<li>Adjust the element size to fit the image.</li>

</ul>
<p>The following table shows which properties are used for 
each image source type.</p>
