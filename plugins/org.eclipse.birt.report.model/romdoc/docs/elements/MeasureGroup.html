<h1>MeasureGroup</h1>

<p>Visual grouping of measure elements. Base class for measure group elements in cube.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The measure group is an abstract element that defines the 
basic properties of a measure group element. The derived elements, tabular and ODA measure
groups, provide measure contents that are defined in this measure group itself.</p>

<p>A measure group creates a visual grouping of measure elements.
The developer controls the order that groups appear in the UI, and 
the order in which measure appear in the group. A runtime UI may choose to 
allow the user to expand &amp; collapse measure groups independently.</p>
