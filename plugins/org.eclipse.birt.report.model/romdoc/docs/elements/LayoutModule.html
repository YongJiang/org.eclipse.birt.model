<h2 class="property">theme</h2>

<p>Specify the theme that is to be used by the design or library.</p>

provided by the included library. When a theme is applied, the report/library
is able to reuse all the styles contained in this theme.</p>

<h2 class="property">libraries</h2>

<p>Libraries that are included by this module.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Includes a list of libraries.</p>

<h2 class="property">propertyBindings</h2>

<p>Binds a property from an element to an expression.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>There is requirement that a property value for an elemenet can be overridden at runtime. 
This list is used to bind a property of an element to an expression, user can override the 
value if expression bind to an parameter.</p>


<h2 class="property">colorPalette</h2>

<p>A set of custom color names.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The developer can define a set of custom color names as 
part of the design. The developer can then reference these names within 
properties. Defining the colors in the palette helps the developer achieve a 
consistent look throughout the report, and allows colors to be refined by 
changing just one place. </p>

<p>Every custom color has three parts: a display name, an 
internal name and an RGB value. The display name is what the developer sees. If 
the palette will be used by people in different countries, then the display name 
can be externalized and translated. The internal name identifies the color 
within the design and in the XML design file. The internal name cannot be 
localized. Finally, the RGB value gives the actual color.</p>

<h2 class="property">configVars</h2>

<p>List of configuration variables.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reports frequently have deployment-specific dependencies. For example,
developers often use a test database during development, but target a production
database once the report is deployed. Or, an OEM may use a different company
name in report titles for each of their customers. BIRT provides configuration
variables to support such cases. A configuration variable is a name/value pair.</p>

<p>See the <code>helpGuide</code> and the
<code>description</code> properties for a way to provide

<h3>Description</h3>

<h2 class="property">images</h2>

<p>A list of images embedded in this report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A design often uses images. Most images in a report will 
be accessed via a URL, or a file deployed externally to the report. However, 
some reports may want to embed an image directly into the report design. 
Embedded images are especially helpful if a report design is generated in a 
custom application and sent to the server for one-time execution.</p>

<p>Images have a name. The name allows an image item to 
reference the embedded image. Scripts can use the image name to retrieve the 
image from the images array:</p>

<pre class="code-block">var img = report.design.images[&quot;MyImage&quot;]</pre>

<h2 class="property">units</h2>
