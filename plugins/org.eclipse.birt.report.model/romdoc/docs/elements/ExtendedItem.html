<h1>ExtendedItem</h1>
<p>Represents an extended item, provide BIRT extenion capability.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
Represents an extended item element. The extended report item
allows third-party developers to create report items that work within BIRT
virtually identically to BIRT-defined items. 

<p>Extended items can use the user-properties discussed above to define properties.
Extended items are defined in a Java plug-in that contributes behavior to the Eclipse 
Report Developer, to the Factory and to the Presentation Engine. 

<p>The extended item can fully participate with the other BIRT extension facilities, 
meaning that report developers can add properties and scripts to an extended item,
providing a very powerful way to create application-specific functionality.
An extended item is defined by a plug-in. The plug-in is specific to BIRT,
and is different from an Eclipse plug-in. Each item plug-in has four parts:
<ul>
<li>Design: handles the model that describes the report item.
<li>User Interface: the UI displayed for the item. This is in the form of an
Eclipse plug-in.
<li>Factory: how to gather the data for the extended item, and compute its
default size in the Factory.
<li>Presentation: how to render the extended item when rendering the report
to HTML, PDF or other formats.
</ul>
