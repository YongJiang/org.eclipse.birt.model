<h1>ReportItem</h1>

<p>Abstract base element for all visual report items.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>ReportItem is the common base element for all visual report elements. Report 
items include a style. The style provides visual characteristics for anything 
that prints in a report: a section or report item.</p>
<p>Report items are positioned within the report based on a series of rules 
described in the ROM Layout Specification. The free-form item provides absolute 
(x, y) positioning, but most other containers provide some kinds of automated 
positioning. The report item provides properties for each kind of layout, but 
the properties are used only when appropriate. For example, every item can have 
an (x, y) position, but the position is ignored unless the item appears within a 
free-form container.</p>
<p>Each report item also has a private style. The private 
style is a separate element in the XML definition. However, within the UI and 
scripting, the style properties appear as though they were properties of this 
item itself.</p>
<h4>Report Item Inheritance</h4>
<p>Report items can extend other report items. However, to keep the system 
manageable, ROM allows a report item to extend only those items defined in a 
library. (Libraries are not yet available in Release 1.0.)</p>
<p>A report item cannot extend another report item that appears in the Body area 
of the report design.</p>
<p>These rules avoid complex designs such as having a container extend the 
container that contains itself. (A determined user can still create this 
scenario within a library, however.)</p><h3>Inherited Properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>name: The inherited name property is optional for report items, except 
for those that are designed for reuse.</li>
</ul>
<h3>See Also</h3>
<h2 class="property">style</h2>

<p>Name of the style applied to this item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Report items provide many style properties. The style 
properties are defined in the <i>ROM Styles Specification</i>. An element can 
inherit its style properties from a parent element, from a named style, or from 
a style that identifies the context in which the item appears. This property 
provides the name of the shared style to use.</p>
<p>This item can also set the value of style properties. 
Properties set on this element &quot;override&quot; those inherited from a parent element 
or a shared style.</p></p>

<h2 class="property">x</h2>

<p>The x (horizontal) position of the item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>The x position of the item. This is an absolute dimension 
relative to from the left of the container. Dimensions include both a measure 
and units: &quot;10in&quot; or &quot;5cm&quot;. The position can also be relative: &quot;10%&quot;.</p>
<p>The position is used only for containers that provide 
absolute positioning. Such containers include the free-form container and the 
graphic master page. Otherwise, the position is computed automatically by the 
container, and this property is ignored.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Dimension property type</p>
<p>Report Item <code> y</code> property</p>
<h2 class="property">y</h2>

<p>The y (vertical) position of the item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>The x position of the item. This is an absolute dimension 
relative to from the top of the container. Dimensions include both a measure and 
units: &quot;10in&quot; or &quot;5cm&quot;. The position can also be relative: &quot;10%&quot;.</p>
<p>The position is used only for containers that provide 
absolute positioning. Such containers include the free-form container and the 
graphic master page. Otherwise, the position is computed automatically by the 
container, and this property is ignored.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Dimension property type</p>
<p>Report Item <code> x</code> property</p>
<h2 class="property">height</h2>

<p>Height of the item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Height of the item. Some items have a dynamic size. In 
this case, this is the minimum height, or may be ignored altogether. The actual 
size in the printed report usually depends on the content, and may be larger 
than the height set here. For example, a data, label or text item will grow as 
tall as required to display its content.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Report Item <code> width</code> property</p>
<h2 class="property">width</h2>

<p>Width of the item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Width of the item. When an item appears as a section (a 
top-level bit of content within the report), the width property is often 
ignored, and is taken to be the width of the page. See the derived elements for 
details.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Report Item <code> height</code> property</p>

<h2 class="property">refTemplateParameter</h2>

<p>Name of the template parameter definition.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>when a report item is created from an <i>template element</i>,
this property will reference to the base template element definition. </p>

<h2 class="property">dataSet</h2>

<p>The name of the data set that provides data for this item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Reference to the data set to use 
for this component. If blank, the data set is that defined for the enclosing 
list, table or other element. See derived elements for the use of the data set 
for that element.</p>

<p>The data set name is optional. If none is provided, then 
the report item &quot;inherits&quot; a data set. A report item used as a section 
automatically uses the first data set defined in the report design. This 
convenience exists to simplify the tasks for customers to create simple reports 
using the XML design format. A report item nested inside a container uses the 
data set for the container.</p>
</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Report Item <code> bindings</code> 
property</p>
<h2 class="property">bookmark</h2>

<p>Defines this item as a hyperlink target.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Many report items can be the target of hyperlinks. The 
bookmark is a string that uniquely identifies the item instance within the 
report. This property is an expression that evaluates to a string. If the string 
is blank or null, then the item has no bookmark. Bookmarks should be unique. If 
there are duplicates, the behavior of the hyperlink is undefined: it may jump to 
the first item with that name.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Action property on labels, data items, images and other 
items.</p>
<h2 class="property">toc</h2>

<p>A table of contents entry for this item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>A table of contents entry for this item. The TOC property 
defines an expression that returns a string that is to appear in the Table of 
Contents for this item or its container.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<h2 class="property">visibility</h2>

<p>A list of visibility rules that determines when the item appears.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>The visibility rules control when the item appears in the 
report. An item can be completely hidden, in which case it won’t even be created 
in the Factory. For example, perhaps the Country item should appear for 
international customers, but not domestic customers. An item can also be hidden 
conditionally depending on the output format. For example, perhaps a hyperlink 
should appear when the report is viewed on the web, but not when it is printed.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>Visibility Rule structure for the details of the rules.</p>
<h2 class="property">paramBindings</h2>

<p>Bindings between input parameters in the included design and values in the main design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>A report item can bind to a data set as described in the 
data set property. A report item can pass information to the data set by 
providing <i>bindings</i> to input parameters of the data set. Each binding 
identifies an input parameter by name, and provides an expression that gives the 
value of the parameter.</p></p>

property</p>
<h2 class="method">onCreate</h2>

<p>Script executed when the element is created in the Factory.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Executed when the element is created in the Factory.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Executed when the element is created in the Factory. 
Called after the item is created, but before the item is saved to the report 
document file. See the scripting spec for additional information about this 
script. Applications should perform visual customization in the on-render script 
instead.</p></p>

<p>Script executed when the element is prepared for rendering in the Presentation engine.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Executed when the element is prepared for rendering 
in the Presentation engine.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Executed when the element is prepared for rendering in 
the Presentation engine. Changes made to the element are written to the target 
output format, but not saved to the report document file. This is the preferred 
place for visual customizations.</p></p>
