<h1>GraphicMasterPage</h1>

<p>A master page with free-form page decorations.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A graphic master page describes a physical page free-form page "decoration". The decoration 
can include simple headers and footers, but can also include content within the left and right 
margins, as well as watermarks under the content area. The page can contain multiple columns. 
In a multi-column report, the content area is the area inside the margins defined by each column.
Note that each page has only one content area, though that content area can be divided into multiple 
columns. That is, a page has one content area. If a page has multiple columns, the column layout is 
"overlaid" on top of the content area.

<h4>Graphic Pages in HTML and FO Output.</h4>

Graphic pages contain free-form content. However, simple HTML output, and 
FO output do not support arbitrary free-form items on a page. If a graphic master 
page is used for such formats, BIRT will automatically convert the graphic page 
to a simple page at run time, following these rules: </h4>
<ul>
<li>A header area is defined above the content area of the page.Any elements entirely within this 
header appear in the printed page header. 
</li>
<li>A footer area is defined below the content area of the page. Any elements entirely within this 
footer appear in the printed page footer.
</li>
<li>Any element that appears outside the header or footer areas is ignored for the simple HTML and FO formats.</li>
</ul>
