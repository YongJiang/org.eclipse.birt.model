<h1>List</h1>

<p>This section describes the list itself.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The list item creates a banded presentation of a set of 
data rows. The data in each band can be in any of the supported section types: 
grid, free-form, text, chart and so on. A list is composed of a series of bands. Each band can 
contain any number of sections. The sections print sequentially. Or, the user 
can attach conditions so that only one of the sections prints for any given list 
or row.</p>

<p>A list can appear as a top-level section (or as a 
subsection within another top-level list). If so, then the bands fill the entire 
width of the page. A list can also appear within a container (grid, table 
cell, free-form, etc.). In this case, the list width is fixed. The list height 
will grow as large as needed to display the list contents.</p>

<p>Table element</p>

<h2 class="slot">header</h2>

<p>Sections that appears before the first row of the list.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The header band appears before the first detail row of a 
list. This band contains any number of sections. Sections appear sequentially 
one after another, or can be selected conditionally.</p>

<p>The header normally appears whether the report contains 
any data rows or not, but the user can change this behavior using expressions.</p>

<p>Report items within the header slot have visibility to 
the entire result set. If the header contains a simple element such as a data 
item, then it will display values from the first row. If the header contains a 
chart, then the chart displays rows from the entire data set. If the header 
displays an aggregate, then the aggregate is computed over the entire data set.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">footer</h2>

<p>A section that appears after the last row of the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The header band appears after the first detail row of a 
list. This band contains any number of sections. Sections appear sequentially 
one after another, or can be selected conditionally.</p>

<p>The footer normally appears whether the report contains 
any data rows or not, but the user can change this behavior using expressions.</p>

<p>Report items within the footer slot have visibility to 
the entire result set. If the footer contains a simple element such as a data 
item, then it will display values from the last row. If the footer contains a 
chart, then the chart displays rows from the entire data set. If the footer 
displays an aggregate, then the aggregate is computed over the entire data set.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">groups</h2>

<p>Groups for the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Groups for the report. The outermost group appears first 
in the list, the innermost group appears last. Each group has a group key, a 
header, a footer and more.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>List Group element</p>

<h2 class="slot">detail</h2>

<p>Sections to print for every row in the query.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The detail band contains the sections to print for each 
row within the list. The list creates a separate instance of the detail band for 
each row. The detail band normally contains simple elements such as a data item.</p>

<p>The detail band can also contain a nested list or table. 
In this case, the nested list or table is repeated for each row in the outer 
list. This is hand to create subreports. For example, outer report displays a 
list of customers, the inner prints a form letter that contains a list of the 
customer’s sales this month.</p>
