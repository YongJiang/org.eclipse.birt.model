<h1>TextData</h1>

<p>Displays a multi-line block of text defined within the 
report.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The text item allows the developer to provide the text as 
part of the report design. The multi-line data item displays blocks of text
retrieved from the database, from a file, or from an expression. The text can be
plain text, HTML. The format of the text can be fixed at design time, or can be
dynamically selected at run time to match the format of the incoming text.</p>

<h2 class="property">contentType</h2>

<p>The formatting within the text: HTML / plain text</p>

<h3>Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>auto: BIRT will infer the 
    format as explained below.</li>

<li>plain: Plain text with no 
    formatting.</li>

<li>html: Formatting using a 
    subset of HTML tags.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The user can explicitly identify the format of the text 
using the Content Type property. Or, the user can set the property to &quot;auto&quot;, 
(or omit the property) and BIRT will infer the format from the text itself.</p>

<p>BIRT determines the text format by examining the first 
few characters of the string. If the first characters are &quot;&lt;HTML&gt;&quot; (in either 
upper case or lower case), then the string is assumed to be HTML. Otherwise, the 
text is plain text. Any white space before these characters is ignored. That is, 
&quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; and &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;html&gt;&quot; are both taken to indicate that the text is formatted 
in HTML.</p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">An
expression that provides the text</span></p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The value expression provides the text to display. The expression is most
often simply a reference to a query column. But, it can also reference a report
parameter, a formula, a special value, a file, or other data item.</p>
