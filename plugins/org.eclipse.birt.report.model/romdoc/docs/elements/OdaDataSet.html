<h1>OdaDataSet</h1>

<p>An extended data set retrieved by a query through an ODA 
driver that implements the BIRT Open Data Access (ODA) interfaces.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The ODA Data Set represents an extended data set that implements the BIRT 
Open Data Access (ODA) interfaces. The ODA interface defines a rich set of 
meta-data attributes available to the BIRT Designer to help the user build the 
report. The ODA Data Set definition contains the minimum amount of information 
necessary to access the desired data source. The rest of the available meta-data 
information is obtained from the ODA driver when needed.</p>

<p>The ODA Data Set element defines a single ODA data set of 
a specific type. An ODA Data Source may support one or more types of ODA data 
sets.</p>

<p>Both the data set element and the ODA driver can provide 
column definition and hints. Data-access attributes, such as name and type, are 
typical derived attributes. They are defined in the Result Set definition, and 
are used only if the runtime driver cannot provide such meta-data. </p>

<p>An ODA driver may statically define driver-specific data 
set query properties by implementing the ODA model extension point (org.eclipse.birt.report.model.odaDriverModel). 
See the BIRT Extensions functional specification document for more detail 
description. By implementing this extension point, an ODA driver’s extension 
plug-in manifest (plugin.xml) could statically define driver-specific data set 
query properties. BIRT supports these driver-defined properties as ROM 
properties with all their built-in features, such as direct editing from the 
BIRT designer’s property sheet. BIRT uniquely identifies each of these 
extension-specified properties within the scope of its ODA extension. From the 
UI perspective, for ease of identifying these driver-specific connection 
properties, one could define them within a group, and name it something like &quot;queryProperties&quot;. 
At Factory time, each of these static driver-defined properties, with its 
defined property name and corresponding value, is passed to the ODA run-time 
driver as runt-time properties.</p>

<p>See the Description of the ODA Data Source element for an 
example of the ODA extension plug-in manifest.</p>

<h2 class="property">type</h2>

<p>The type of data set supported by the ODA driver.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The type of data set supported by the ODA driver. The 
type is specific to each ODA driver, and is defined in the driver’s extension 
plug-in manifest (plugin.xml). Its value is optional if the ODA driver supports 
only one type of data set.</p>

<h2 class="property">queryText</h2>

<p>The static query text to execute.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The query text used in opening a data set. Specific ODA 
driver defines the format of this string. The query text is passed through to 
the ODA runtime driver to prepare a statement for execution.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">resultSetName</h2>

<p>Identifies which result set to access if a query returns multiple result sets.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some ODA drivers provide multiple named result sets from 
a single query. In the first release, BIRT can access only one of these result 
sets. This property identifies which named result set to access. The inherited
<code>resultSet</code> definition, 
if specified, is for this result set. </p>

<p>Required if multiple result sets are available, and a 
result set must be accessed by name. This property is not applicable when 
multiple result sets are returned in sequence; the first result set is treated 
as the primary result set.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<h2 class="property">privateDriverProperties</h2>

<p>A list of dynamic name-value structures that specify private data or attributes specific to the ODA data set query.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A list of dynamic name-value structures (<code>ExtendedProperty</code> 
structures) that specify private runtime data or attributes specific to the ODA 
data set. This is an optional element that an ODA driver may use to store and 
pass pertinent driver-specific attributes from its designer tool to the runtime 
driver. The content of this element is specific and private to an ODA driver, 
whose designer tool can dynamically define and update them as appropriate. 
These name-value pairs are stored in the report design file as a persistent 
service, and are passed to the ODA runtime driver at Factory time. </p>

<p><code>ExtendedProperty</code> structure</p>

<h2 class="property">privateDriverDesignState</h2>

<p>The private design state of the ODA driver’s designer tool.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The private design state of the ODA driver’s designer 
tool. Its value is opaque to BIRT, and is stored in the report design file as a 
persistent service only. Optional.</p>
