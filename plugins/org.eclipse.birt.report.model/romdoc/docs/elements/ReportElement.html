<h1>ReportElement</h1>

<p>Abstract element for user-visible elements.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The abstract report element represents anything that can be named and 
customized. Most of the major components in ROM derive from the Report Element. These are the elements visible in 
the GUI: data sets, styles, master pages, report items and so on.</p>
<h3>See Also</h3>
<p>ReportItem element</p>
<h2 class="property">name</h2>

<p>Internal element name used to reference the element within the report design and in scripts.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>

<p>ROM report elements can have a name. The name is required 
for some elements, but is optional for most others. Items that require a name 
are those that exist to be referenced elsewhere: parameters, data sources, data 
sets, styles, and so on. Other elements are generally not referenced. The 
developer provides a name only if the s/he finds it convenient to do so. Names 
also make it easier to work with components in custom scripts. If the name is 
omitted, the component is anonymous but can still be found in code by traversing 
the design hierarchy. See the description of the derived concrete elements for 
details. </p>
<p>This property provides the name for the element used 
internally in designer and in user scripts. The name cannot be localized. As 
noted above, the name is optional for most elements. If the name is provided, it 
must be unique with its name space (as defined for each element.) Names can 
contain any character from any language, including spaces, punctuation and so 
on. ROM names are case-sensitive.</p></p>

property</p>
<h2 class="property">extends</h2>

<p>Allows an element to extend another element of the same type.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>

<p>Most elements can inherit properties, styles and behavior 
from another element of the same type. For example, a label can inherit from 
another label. This property identifies the &quot;parent&quot; element by name. The parent 
must exist. If it does not, the ERD will display an error and the report won’t 
run.</p>
<p>ROM uses prototype-based inheritance, much like 
JavaScript. Suppose derived element D extends parent element P. The <i>effective 
value</i> of the property of element D is found by first looking for the 
property value in the definition of element D. If the property is not set in 
element D, then BIRT repeats the search in element P. P may in turn extend yet 
another element, and the search repeats for P’s parent. The search terminates if 
when there are no more parent elements to search. In this case, the property 
takes its default value as defined in this specification.</p>
<p>Style properties use an additional level of search as 
defined in the style specification.</p>
<p>Some properties do not inherit. These include the Extends 
property itself, and the Name property. The specification for each property 
identifies whether or not it inherits.</p>
<p>In Release 1.0, the model and schema supports the extends property, but the 
GUI does not.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<h2 class="property">comments</h2>

<p>Information about this element for people who work on 
the design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>The comments provide information about this element for 
people who work on the design. This text can contain embedded HTML formatting 
tags; but cannot be localized.</p></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>
<h2 class="property">displayName</h2>

<p>Provides a user-friendly name for the element.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>The name to show for this element in the UI. Display 
names are most often used for components put into libraries, or that will be 
used for the future web reporting tool. The name can be externalized.</p>
<p>The display name is most often provided for reusable 
components, especially those to be used by casual users within the web report 
designer.</p></p>

<h2 class="property">displayNameID</h2>

<p>Message ID property for the display name.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>The display name of the element can be externalized, the ID property will
link to an external message key where the user put his message files.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">eventHandlerClass</h2>
<p>The full qulified name of the event handler class.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Full quilified name of the event handler class, used to specify an external Java class
which define the scripting behavior that will be executed at runtime.</p>
