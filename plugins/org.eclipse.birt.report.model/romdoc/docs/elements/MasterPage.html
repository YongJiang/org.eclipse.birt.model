<h1>MasterPage</h1>

<p>Base element for master pages within a report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The master page is an abstract element that defines the 
basic properties of a page. The derived elements, Simple and Graphic Master 
Pages, provide content that appears on the page itself. The simple master page 
is best for use with simple reports, or reports targeted for the web. Graphic 
master pages provide a robust set of formatting capabilities and are ideal for 
sophisticated web layouts or printed reports.</p>

<p>The master page element is a kind of Report Element. Some 
of the inherited attributes have a special meaning. The Name property provides 
the name of the master page and is required. The page name must be unique within 
the design. The name is used to create a page sequence, and to associate master 
pages with report elements.</p>

<p>Master pages cannot extend another master page, and so 
the extends property is ignored.</p>

<p>The master page implicitly defines 
a content area. In a single-column report, the content area is the area inside 
the margins.</p>

<h2 class="property">style</h2>

<p>Name of the style applied to this item.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Master pages provide many style properties. The style 
properties are defined in the <i>ROM Styles Specification</i>. An element can 
inherit its style properties from a parent element (which does not apply to 
master pages), from a named style, or from a style that identifies the context 
in which the item appears. This property provides the name of the shared style 
to use.</p>

<p>This item can also set the value of style properties. 
Properties set on this element &quot;override&quot; those inherited from a parent element 
or a shared style.</p>
