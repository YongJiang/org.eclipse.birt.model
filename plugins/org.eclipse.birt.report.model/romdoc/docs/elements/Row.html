<h2 class="property">style</h2>

<p>Name of the style applied to this row.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><p>Rows provide many style properties. The style properties 
are defined in the <i>ROM Styles Specification</i>. An element can inherit its 
style properties from a parent element, from a named style, or from a style that 
identifies the context in which the item appears. This property provides the 
name of the shared style to use.</p>
<p>This item can also set the value of style properties. 
Properties set on this element &quot;override&quot; those inherited from a parent element 
or a shared style.</p></p>

<p>All properties defined for a style appear as 
properties on report items also. See the Style element for the list of 
properties that appear here.</p>
