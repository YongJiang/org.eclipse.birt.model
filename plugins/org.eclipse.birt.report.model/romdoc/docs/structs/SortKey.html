<p>An expression that gives the sort key on which to 
sort.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An expression that gives the sort key on which to sort. 
The simplest case is the name of a column. The expression can also be an 
expression that includes columns. When used for a group, the expression can 
contain an aggregate computed over the group.</p>

<p>Expressions that include only a column name are 
candidates for &quot;pushing&quot; into the data set. However, sort keys that are 
expressions must be evaluated within BIRT, and so the sorting itself must occur 
within BIRT.</p>
