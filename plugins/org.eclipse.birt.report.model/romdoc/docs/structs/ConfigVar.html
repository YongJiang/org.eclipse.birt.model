<h1>ConfigVar</h1>
<p>Define a varialbe mostly for deployment-specific purpose.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A report can have deployment-specific dependencies. For example, report developers
ofen use a test database during development, but target a production database once the
report is deployed online. Or, an OEM company may use a different company name in report 
titiles for each of their customers.</p>

<p>Experiences suggest that changing the report design to reflect these changes is both
tedious and error-prone. We need a simple solution. Therefore, BIRT provides <i>configuration 
variables</i>.  A configuration variable is simply a name/value pair very similar to an
environment variable in Unix. Indeed, configuration variables include environment variables, 
along with BIRT-specific values.

<h2 class="property">name</h2>
<p>Name of the variable.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A configuration variable has a unique and required name, report use the name to references 
a configuration variable.</p>

<h2 class="property">value</h2>
<p>Value of the configuration variable.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Value of the configuration variable, report can override this value to provide a default value.</p>
