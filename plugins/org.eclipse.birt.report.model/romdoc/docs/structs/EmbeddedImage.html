<h1>EmbeddedImage</h1>
<p>Holds an reusable image embedded within the design file.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>BIRT allows images to be embedded within the design file. This is most useful for reports
created in an external application and submitted to a server for immediate, one-time execution.
If report designs are created with the BIRT designer, and are saved on disk, the developer will 
probably find it easier to use external images referenced with a file name or URL.</p>


<h2 class="property">name</h2>
<p>Name of the embbed image.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Name is required for an embedded image, and it should be unique within all the embedded images.</p>

<h2 class="property">type</h2>
<p>Format type of the image.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Defines the type of the image using MIME types. Many image formats provides a unique "Magic Number" at
the first few bytes of the image raw data. However, this solution is not guaranteed to work for all images
and all image formats. To avoid problems, the application should specify the image type whenever possible.
</p>

<h2 class="property">data</h2>
<p>The binary data for the image.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This property contains the image itself as an array of bytes. Data is store in the XML design file using
base-64 encoding.</p>

<h2 class="property">libReference</h2>
<p>Property that holds a reference to an embbeded image in a target library.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>When reuse an embedded image from a library, a local embbeded image is created which has a reference to 
the base image in the target library. That's very similar to element extends, which has a child-parent 
relationship</p>
