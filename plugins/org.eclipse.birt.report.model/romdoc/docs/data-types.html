<h1>Data Types</h1>

<p>The following lists the 
data types used within this specification. The JavaScript types below are the 
types of the design-time information. See the specification if there is an 
additional run-time type. (For example, an expression is a string at design 
time, but will evaluate to a string or integer or other value at runtime.)</p>

<p>A property can be a list: 
in this case the property is a list of values such as structures, strings, etc.</p>

<h4>Property Lists</h4>

<p>A list property is defined as being a “list of x” where x can be one of the 
simple data types, or one of the structures defined below. A list property is 
represented as an array in JavaScript. For example, the list of custom colors 
for a report design is represented by a list property. The following obtains the 
structure that defines the third custom color:</p>

<pre class="code-block">var colorDefn = designDefn.palette[ 2 ];</pre>

<p>A property list is composed of a series of values. In general, the values 
appear in the list in the same order that they appear in the report design XML 
file, which generally reflects the order in which they were created in the UI.</p>

<h2>boolean</h2>

<p>A simple true/false value.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides a simple true/false value. The values are represented by the 
JavaScript true and false values in scripts and expressions. They are 
represented as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; in the XML file.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>


<h2>choice</h2>

<p>The value must be selected from a predefined list of choices.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The choice property type indicates that a property provides a fixed set of 
choices. Any property of this type must also provide a separate list of the 
choices. The list of choices is defined as a separate named &quot;choice set.&quot;</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>


<h2>color</h2>

<p>An RGB color value or color name. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Represents a color. Colors can use the CSS color names, a CSS-format RGB 
value (#RRGGBB), or a custom color name defined within the report.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2>dateTime</h2>

<p>A date/time value. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A date/time value in (what format?) Not used in Release 1.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2>dimension</h2>

<p>A physical dimension.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A CSS dimension. The units are expressed as a floating point number such as 
“1.25”. To override that default, specify a suffix as one of “in” (inches), “mm” 
(millimeters), “cm” (centimeters), “pt” (points), “pc” (picas), “%” (percent), 
“em” (“em” size for the current font) or “ex” (“ex” size for the current font.)</p>

<p>A dimension is a physical measurement. Dimensions always have a unit. 
Supported units include the following defined in CSS:</p>

<table class="section-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Unit Suffix</td>
      <td>Meaning</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>cm</td>
    <td>Centimeters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>in</td>
    <td>Inches</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mm</td>
    <td>Millimeters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pt</td>
    <td>Points (1/72 of an inch)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pc</td>
    <td>Pica (1 pica is equal to 12 points)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>px</td>
    <td>Pixels. (For print, see the CSS spec. A 
    pixel is about 0.21 mm.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>em</td>
    <td>ems, the height of the element's font</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ex</td>
    <td>x-height, the height of the letter 'x'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%</td>
    <td>Percentage. The definition of each property identifies the container 
    property from which the value is computed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>element</h2>

<p>A reference to another element in the design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A reference to another element in the design. BIRT automatically updates the

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A BIRT expression using

<h2>extends</h2>

<h2>name</h2>

<p>The name field of a structure within a property defined as a structure list.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identifies a property within a structure that provides the name to be used 
for associative lookup in property lists.</p>

<h4>Associative Property Lists</h4>

<p>All property lists allow numeric indexes. Some also allow associative lookup 
using the name of an item in the list. For example, to look up the custom color: 
“seaGreen”:</p>

<pre class="code-block">var colorDefn = designDefn.palette.seaGreen</pre>

<p>or,</p>

<pre class="code-block">var colorDefn = designDefn.palette[ “seaGreen” ]</pre>

<p>The first form can be used when the name to be looked up is known when the 
code is written, and follow the JavaScript identifier naming rules. The second 
form can be used to look up a value when the value is not known ahead of time, 
or when the name does not follow JavaScript identifier rules. For example:</p>

<pre class="code-block">var colorDefn = designDefn.palette[ params.colorName ];
var colorDefn = designDefn.palette[ “Sea-Green” ]</pre>

<p>The associative lookup is provided when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list contents are structures, and</li>
  <li>Exactly one of the properties within the structure is of type Name.</li>
</ul>
